"""
Experimance-specific constants.

This file contains constants that are specific to the Experimance project.
These constants are automatically merged with the base constants when
PROJECT_ENV=experimance.
"""

# Add Experimance-specific constants here
# These will override or extend the base constants

# For example, if you need different port configurations:
# CUSTOM_PORTS = {
#     "experimance_special": 5580,
# }

# Or override specific base constants:
# DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 2000  # Override the base default timeout

# Project-specific paths or settings:
# EXPERIMANCE_SPECIFIC_SETTING = "experimance_value"

# You can also extend the DEFAULT_PORTS dictionary from base:
# from experimance_common.constants_base import DEFAULT_PORTS
# DEFAULT_PORTS.update({
#     "experimance_custom": 5580,
# })

# For now, we'll keep this minimal since most constants are already appropriate
# for Experimance in the base file
