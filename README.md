# Experimance Software

This repository contains the software components for Experimance, an interactive art installation system.

## Main Software

The primary, fully operational software is located in the [`experimance/`](./experimance/) subdirectory.

**→ [Go to Experimance Software](./experimance/)**

This contains the complete Python-based system for running interactive art installations, including:
- Multi-service architecture with ZeroMQ communication
- AI-generated imagery and audio
- Real-time audience interaction detection
- Sand table visualization
- Voice agent capabilities

See the [full documentation](./experimance/README.md) for installation, setup, and usage instructions.

## Additional Components

The following components are under development and not yet fully operational:

- **`godot_display/`**: Godot game engine based display software (experimental)
- **`transition_rs/`**: Rust-based image transition generator (experimental)

These may be integrated into future versions but are not required for running Experimance installations currently.
